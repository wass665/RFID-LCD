# RFID-LCD
A template of C++ code that programs an ESP32 interface with an LCD screen and RFID-RC522 sensor

This is a template i created for an ESP32 (can also be uploaded to other boards) where an RFID sensor (RFID-RC522) is connected along with an LCD 16x2 screen.
It takes an RFID inpit and compares it to a preset UID of an RFID card and if the correct one is presented, the LCD says "Access granted" otherwise "Access denied".
